            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or as much as I having put forth a Book, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I proved <hi>Edward Burrough,</hi> and all his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low quaking Prophets falſe upon their own grounds the which the ſaid <hi>Burrough,</hi> nor his Brother <hi>James Naylor</hi> have given any anſwer unto, notwithſtanding the ſaid <hi>Naylor</hi> did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a pretended anſwer, in which he took no other courſe to confute me, then charging me to deny the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and all above nature, and that without ground, or colour of ground, as my Book doth clearly manifeſt; but for the proofs I bring to prove them falſe, deceiving, jugling Prophets, upon their own grounds, he ſaith, hee I leave to the wiſe to judge, himſelf not being wiſe enough, he either being convinced, that it was a truth, or no wayes able to take away thoſe Arguments I brought to prove it.</p>
            <p>And now notwithſtanding the ſaid <hi>Burrough,</hi> and his fellow quaking Prophets ſtand thus condemned by the name of quaking Prophets, to be falſe, deceiving jugling Prophets, upon their own grounds: yet the ſaid <hi>Burrough</hi> being ſo perfect, as ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99878:3"/>nothing, notwithſtanding this heinous charge againſt him, proudly aſſumeth that he hath received order and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the ſpirit of the living God, to write a controverſie to all the Inhabitants of the Earth; among which he accuſeth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth, and ſentenceth <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> Lord Protector, his Counſel, the Judges, and divers others, with near ten ſeveral ſorts of Opinions, and Sects of Religions, to be all under the wrath, and high diſpleaſure of God.</p>
            <p>But for his fellow Quakers, he ſalutes them, and ſaith, they are the Lords choyce ones, his holy Seed, with whom he hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Covenant that they ſhall raign over Hell &amp; death, and the Crave<note n="*" place="margin">It is ſaid of a People in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> that they held forth ſuch pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and zeal, and heavenly minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they ſeemed to hate the World, and worldly things, till they had got a conſiderable party; and then they argued, that the Earth was the Lords, and that they being his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People, the worthy right owners thereof, none had nothing to do with it but they.</note> and having proclamed open War againſt <hi>God</hi> &amp; <hi>Magog,</hi> he incourageth his Brethren to proſicute it, (ſaying) that ſo they may inlarge their Dominions, and make the Sons of <hi>Eſau</hi> their ſlaves and bondmen.</p>
            <p>Wherefore for as much as theſe young upſtart-Quakers do thus proudly exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above others, I ſhall endeavour to unmask them, by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their dark ſide outward, wherein lyeth the ſtrength of their deluſion, and diſcover to the World that the Quakers drive on two dangerous deſignes; the one by their Doctrine, the which leadeth to the deſtruction of the well-being of the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſecond, by the Sword, in which they have manifeſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of diſſimulation.</p>
            <p>To make the firſt appear, I ſhall take notice of four particulars, the which I have gathered out of their exerciſe, out of their Books, and by diſcourſing with them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the peoples ſenſes, underſtanding, and reaſon, were carnall, fleſhly, and unto condemnation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That Chriſt lighteneth every one that commeth into the World.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:99878:3"/>
            <p>Thirdly, That who ſo believes in this light, it is as a fire and a Hammer, to break and conſume all carnal luſt, and fleſhly and ſelfiſh deſires whatſoever, that now they cannot ſin.</p>
            <p>Fourthly That now the Scripture is no more a guid for them to walk by, nor nothing without them, but the light within them, and he that ſeeketh after any other Guid, but that within him is in the fleſh ſtill.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, this young Harlot hath learned of her Mother, the old Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> how to lay the firſt ſtone in this Tragedy the which is in the peoples ignorance; for as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forbiddeth the people to truſt to their own underſtanding, but to believe as the Church believes, ſo the Daughter denyeth, as it were her followers the uſe of their ſenſes, their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Reaſon, (notwithſtanding God hath given theſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the Sons of men, out of which ariſeth their chiefeſt light, by which they are to try all things, and hold that which is good;) but telleth them that they are carnall, and unto condemnation, that ſo they may wholly relie upon their infallibilities; even as a cunning Fouler, who with the ſound of a Bell aſtoniſheth and benummeth the ſenſes of the Birds, that they have no power to fly away, but yield themſelves up as a prey; ſo do theſe jugling quaking Prophets, aſtoniſh and benum the ignorant unſtayd-minded people with their lies, that they are as brutiſh as thoſe in the 44. of <hi>Iſay.</hi> (that with one part of a Tree roaſted their meat, and warmed themſelves, and with the reſidue they made them a God, and called upon it for deliverance,) otherwiſe they might require theſe deceivers to caſt away their own ſenſes, and their reaſon, and their own underſtanding firſt, and then there would be no danger of their deceiving others.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, that Chriſt lightneth every one that commeth into the World it is a truth clear from Scripture, and that this light is ſeated in the underſtanding, and diſcovereth to every one that will both good and evill.</p>
            <p>But for the third, that this light doth conſume and deſtroy all carnal luſt, is moſt falſe, and contrary both to Scripture and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for the nature of light is but to diſcover, and is not active at all: but in diſcovering, take it in the body, light, or eves, they are but to diſcover and inform the underſtanding of what they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99878:4"/>ſee; as the eares do of what they hear, ſo the light in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding acts nor neither, but only determinates of what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto it, and ſo delivereth up its ſenſe to the will, who as an executioner, putteth the body in action, even as an artificial light: take a Candle into a dark Room, its nature is to diſcover what is in that Room; but if you light a hundred Candles, they will not remove any thing in that Room.</p>
            <p>And therefore if the Quakers will have their Diſciples purged, they muſt ſeek ſomething elſe, for light will not do it, an to they are all ſtill in their abominations, and that the reaſons why <hi>Nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> is not aſhamed to put to print ſuch notorious abominable lyes, and <hi>Burrough</hi> outſtrips the Heathen in revengeful expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, againſt all but his own fraternity, quite contrary to what he had taught, and therefore the leſſe is the wonder though they do outſtrip all falſe Prophets and deceivers, ſeeing they are ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the greateſt abomination that ever was before them.</p>
            <p>Howſoever, I cannot but take notice of the ſubtilty of this young Harlot, who puts one pure truth among three erors as a bait to inſnare the poor ignorant people withall, and therefore for as much as I intend to chaſe their Harlot through all their muſes, I will lend her ſo much favour, as to preſuppoſe that light doth cleanſe and purifie.</p>
            <p>Yet do I deny that light, or any thing within man, or without him, doth or ever did, ſo cleanſe, purifie and make perfect the Sons of men, as that it were ſafe &amp; convenient to allow them no other guid or director but the dictate of their own light and ſpirit within them, and that ever any of the dear Servants of God were juſtly capable of ſuch a condition, their own compliance wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the contrary, yea, <hi>Adam</hi> in his chiefeſt purity, was ſhort of this capacity.</p>
            <p>And therefore to ſtrip this young Harlot out of her pretences, I ſhall open this word Perfection, and ſhew what it is, and where it lieth, what imperfection is, and from whence it ariſeth, for herein lieth the ſtrength of their deluſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Perfection is a fulneſs in the mind and appetite of the Creature, whereby it can comfortably ſubſiſt without ſupply to either.</p>
            <p>Secondly, imperfection is an emptineſs in the mind and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99878:4"/>of the Creature, ſo that it cannot comfortably ſubſiſt without ſupply to either.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> had been created in the firſt, he had not ſinned, becauſe mans ſin ariſeth from his enordinatings acting and deſiring to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the emptineſs of his mind and appetite ſo he could not have fulfilled the end for which God made him for, the which was to dreſſe the Garden; for labor in it ſelf being burdenſome, and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs is the only provocation thereunto; for the ſweetneſs of the morſel ſets an edge upon induſtry, when the full loatheth the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-combe.</p>
            <p>But the Lord created <hi>Adam</hi> to dreſſe the Garden, and in order thereunto he was made ſubſiſtent by ſupply the which he at once thought to ſatisfie and therefore was eaſily perſwaded ſeeing the apple good to ſatisfie his appetite, and to be as good to ſatisfie the ambition of his mind, he by his acting and deſiring enordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately (that is, quite contrary to what the Lord commanded) purchaſed defilement to him and his poſterity for ever.</p>
            <p>But if <hi>Adam</hi> had been a Quaker, and God had left him to their claim, that it is to walk by that light within him; If <hi>Adam</hi> had ſet fire of all the Trees in the Garden, as well as eat the fruit of one, he had not ſinned he doing it from the dictate of that light the which was allowed him for his guid: wherefore ſeeing the Quakers cannot prove that that light within man, or any thing elſe, either within him, or without him, doth reconſtitute man into a more pure and perfect eſtate and condition, then God ever intended to create man in (the which is unpoſſible) then is it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to prove that the Quakers Doctrine doth unavoidably lead to the utter deſolation of the whole Creation.</p>
            <p>Their Doctrine being that all they believe in that light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt lighteneth every man that commeth into the World, the Scripture is now no guid for him to walk by, nor nothing elſe without him, but only that light within him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Now ſuppoſe a City, a Kingdom, or the whole World ſhould embrace this Doctrine; ſuppoſe the whole World were as pure as <hi>Adam</hi> was in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether every one would not be as ready as <hi>Adam</hi> was, to lay hold of what he apprehended would beſt ſatisfie his empty hand and appetite, yea much more readier, when they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99878:5"/>ſo to do; and that they may do it without ſin, being free from Law, and power of penalty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And whether it might not be expected, that the generality of the Sons and Daughters of men (if not all) would not improve and put in exerciſe their chiefeſt ſtrength to procure their beſt contentment.</p>
            <p>And now ſeeing this is our Quakers Paradiſe to turn ſin our of the World, by making all Laws uſeleſs, let all wiſe and prudent people conſider, whether he that had a coat to day, might not want one to morrow; and he that had bread to day, might not be uncertain when he ſhould have any bread again; for who would give his mind, or be induſtrious, when all he laboured for might be juſtly taken from him; yea, whether man would not be quickly made more miſerable then the beaſt of the field; for as he would ſoon be brought to eat graſs as an Oxe: yet in Winter if he would eat hay he might ſtarve before he could have it; for who will provide it ſince none knows who ſhall enjoy it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond deſign is gathered from the revengfull ſpirit that appeareth to be in theſe Quaking Prophets, manifeſted in <hi>Edr. Burroughs</hi> Salutation to his Brethren the Quakers; wherein be doth ſufficiently diſcover his imperfection, in changing from one thing to another: For about two years ago in his Exerciſt in <hi>Whitecroſ</hi> ſtreet he declared to the people that thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in that light with which Chriſt lighteneth every one that cometh into the World, that Light doth break and conſume all Carnall I uſt, and ſelfiſh deſires whatſoever, and purifieth the heart ſo that they cannot ſinne; and that all ſtrife and contention and revenge was of the fleſh, and of the Divel, and were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
            <p>But now in his book entituled, <hi>(A feigned) Trumpet of the Lord ſounded out of</hi> Sion after he had judged, condemned ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all Degrees and Religions that he knew of, to be all under the high diſpleaſure of God:</p>
            <p>But to his Confederates the Quakers he ſalures them, relling them <hi>That they are the Lords choſen ones out of the Earth, to place his Name among them.</hi> And having with theſe high conceits filled up four pages, he plainly diſcovers a <hi>German</hi> ſpirit, that as he had cryed down the World, and Worldly things, together with all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99878:5"/>ſtrife and contention, and revenge to be carnal, and of the Devil, and unto condemnation, he hath in this ſmall moment of time, by his infallible ſpirit turned all theſe vices into vertues, ſo that now the whole World is become little enough for their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; his words are theſe in the 37. page.</p>
            <p>Make Warre in righteouſneſs, and prepare your ſelves to do his ſervice, let not your hands be ſlack, neither be you ſloathful in our Lords deſign, but wound the head of your enemies, and manage Warre againſt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> throughout all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ride on and proſper, and tread down the fenced Cities, and enlarge your Dominion, and let the Children of ſtrangers, of the Seed of <hi>Eſau,</hi> be your ſlaves and bond-men, and fill the Earth with your preſence.</p>
            <p>And in the 39. page, O <hi>Sion,</hi> thou art prepared of thy God to beat the Mountains to duſt; thou art fitted for his ſervice to threſh the Hills. Make no tarrying, but come away, ſpread thy ſelf into every corner of the Earth; for the upright thirſt for thee.</p>
            <p>And in the 40. page; for thy God hath given thee an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with teeth, to beat the Rocks to powder; he is not wanting to thee in power and wiſdom: thou Son of his love, give up, give up to obey his voice, and love not thy life unto death, till the Seed of thy Inheritance, and the blood of thy choſen be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged upon the head of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> who hath ſlain thy Elect in all Generations, and nouriſhed her ſelf with the blood of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; call upon thy God, and awake him to revenge, to ſmite, and to ſlay thy adverſaries, and to conſume their Habitation from off the Earth, who have been too ſtrong for thee: why ſhouldeſt thou not come forth in the power of thy judgements, to judge the Earth in righteouſneſs, and exalt thy name in glory?</p>
            <p>Now for as much as I have not an infallible ſpirit, infallibly to interpret what may be intended in theſe revengefull expreſſions, notwithſtanding my Imaginary faculty might find ground e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of bad conſequence in them, yet I ſhall leave them to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judgements, and take the boldneſs to inquire;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether <hi>Edward Burrough</hi> doth mean <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture ſo far remote, and unknown, and the Sons of <hi>Eſau</hi> ſo long agoe dead: or whether he means thoſe to whom

            <p n="3">3. Whether <hi>Mahomet,</hi> when he was of the Quakers age, (the which is under ſeven years) was not as unlikely to be numerous as the Quakers are?</p>

            <p n="5">5.

            <p n="6">6.

               <head>An Anſwer, to <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation to his Fellow-Quakers, ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of his lying Trumpet.</head>
               <p>O How hath Satan filled thy heart, and with what power of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination hath he poſſeſt thee, that thou ſhould'ſt thus exalt thy ſelf like an Eagle, as if thy neſt were in the Stars? Knoweſt thou not, that the try umphing of the Wicked is ſhort, and the joy of the Hypocrite but for a moment? And that the Lord hath a controverſie with the proud look, and the lying tongue? of both thou art extreamly guilty as doth plainly appear, in that thou condemneth all the people in the world, to be all under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the wrath of God; and then proudly preſumeth, that thou and thy fraturnity the Quakers are the onely people the Lord delights in: And thus thou makeſt the poor ignorant people glad with thy lyes, the which thou telleſt both againſt God and Man. O thou proud preſumptuous ambitious Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker! where is thy original, or from whence was thou hewen but out of a haughty proud imagination; thou art not yet ſeven years old, and are thou the onely people of the whole Creation in the favour of the Almighty? Had he no people before thou appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redſt? Or did he caſt them all away to take the high preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Quaker? Sure the youngneſs of thy years maketh thy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence a miracle: therefore, woe be to them that live to ſee thee proſperous to a manly age. Again, from what Original doſt thou draw thy Opinions? for from the Scripture thou doſt not: for thou denieſt the worſhip of the Scripture, and the Faith of the Scriptures and the obedience.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Thou denieſt all matter and form of woſhip; and where there is neither of theſe, there neither is nor can be any manner of Worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>You deny the Faith of all the Saints and people of God in the Scripture; for</hi> James Naylor <hi>in the</hi> 62. <hi>pag of his</hi> [Love to the Loſt] <hi>denies that to be the Faith of Chriſt that doth not ſet men free from ſin while they liveth. Now in the ſame page, upon another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he citeth the</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>and he ſaith [the Apoſtle ſpeaks plain words to that purpoſe] now the ſame Apoſtle in the</hi> 7. <hi>of the</hi> Rom. <hi>from the</hi> 14. <hi>to the end of the Chapter-ſpeaks as plain words to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99878:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>namely, that when he writ that Epiſtle, he had ſin in him; and yet at this time he was poſſeſſed of the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt to ſalvation, in as great a meaſure, as any ever had is clearly proved in Scripture. And</hi> 1 Joh. 1.8. <hi>as plainly ſaith,</hi> If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and there is no truth in us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thou denieſt the obedience of the Scripture, in that thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieſt actual obedience, yea and the authority of the Scripture too: for whereas the authority of the Scripture, both in the New and Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is full of Laws, Statutes, and Command, if there is no actuall obedience then they are but as common Hiſtory: therefore thou being oppoſite to the Scriptures Worſhip, Faith, and Obedience, let us examine how they own thy Opinions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Where it can be proved, that that Light whereby Chriſt lighteneth every one that comes into the world is as a hammer and fire to break and conſume all carnal Luſt whatſoever, or doth at all mortifie and conſume Carnal Luſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us examine what Worſhip it is thou holdeſt hard forth. In the</hi> 10. <hi>page of</hi> Naylors [Love to the Loſt] <hi>he fills up three pages about Worship, when leſs then one line would contain the ſubſtance of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that was no other</hi> [but as every Creature is moved by the Spirit of the Living God] <hi>and here is all the ſubſtance of this large Story, the which he doth upon purpoſe to bemuſe and confound the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that ſo they might be kept off from the ſerious Examination of the premiſes; but I reſolve not to be deceived by him; and therefore ſhall take notice, that if</hi> Moſes <hi>had taught no other Worſhip to the</hi> Jewes, <hi>nor Chriſt and the Apoſtles to the Gentiles, they had made way for as great abominations as the Quakers do; for as all Worſhips would have been one as another, ſo every Worſhip would have been as good as another; yea, the</hi> Turk <hi>the</hi> Pope <hi>and all the</hi> Heathen-Worſhippers <hi>in the world, might approve themſelves upon this Doctrine as true Worſhippers, as</hi> James Naylor, <hi>the Lyers, Murderers, and to Whoremongers, and all whatſoever, every one will ſay its from the Spirit of the Living God; and therefore in that</hi> James Naylor <hi>doth acknowledge in his writings, that there is a Carnal Spirit, and a Spirit of the Devil he ſhould have given ſome infallible Character to know the Spirit of God from other Spirits (as Chriſt doth to know a true Prophet from a falſe) had not his wiſdome been as ſmall as his honeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Now ſeeing the Scripture can ſay nothing for thee in the good ſenſe, let us try whether it knoweth thee in the evill; ſeeing it cannot
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99878:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>prove thee a true Prophit, let us ſee whether it can prove thee a falſe.</hi>

               <p>Chriſt in the 7. of <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. biddeth, <hi>Beware of falſe Prophets;</hi> and in the 10. <hi>ver.</hi> he telleth us, that we may know them by their fruits the which fruits was the diſtinguiſhing Character to know a true Prophet from a falſe. Now this Character was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> pretences of Holineſs, for that had the falſe Prophets: for the Text ſaith, that they come in ſheeps cloathing; neither was it manifeſtation of the Tongues; for that the falſe Prophets could do likewiſe: But this diſtinguiſhing Character was works one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereby a true Prophet or Apoſtle was known from a falſe; yea, and thus did Chriſt diſtinguiſh himſelf from all falſe Chriſts alſo: and therefore he ſaith, <hi>the works that I do, bear witneſ of me;</hi> and further he ſaith, <hi>That if he had not done work amongſt them that never none did their rejecting of him had been no ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore when he commanded his Diſciples to go preach unto the world, the which was ſufficient on their parts to put their Commiſſion in execution: yet for as much as this was no diſtinguiſhing Character, he commanded them to ſtay at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> till he had provided on the peoples part ſomething whereby to ground their Faith upon, that they might be ſure they were of his ſending; and in order thereunto, he indued them with ſuch Heavenly Demonſtrations, that all the world could not furniſh a falſe Apoſtle or Prophet withall. And therefore, forasmuch as <hi>Jame: Naylor</hi> did engage [in <hi>Beech</hi>-lane] to prove himſelf a true Prophet, and yet could give no other manifeſtation then every man in the World may do [that hath but that impudency and art of our-facing] and being told, that what he ſaid would not prove he was a true Prophet, he bid them prove that he was not a true Prophet; the which had been needleſs, becauſe that very requeſt was a ſufficient demonſtration of a falſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The next thing conſiderable, is, thy ſubtilty how to make thy ſelf numerous, not having the Magiſtrate ſword, as the old Whore thy Mother had, without which ſhe had been no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the ignorant ſort would have made her: for ſhe by harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the narrow way to life the Scripture ſpeaks of, in order thereunto, ſhe afflicts her followers with many chaſtiſements and purgatories: But forasmuch as thou holdſt forth the broad way, that all that believe in that light, with which Chriſt lighteneth every one that cometh into the world, they then are to walk by that light within them; and for as much as thou holdſt forth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99878:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>no rule to try whether they believe or no, but only ſayſt they do; thou muſt take in all that will but ſay they believe, and they are the member, of thy body; and being ſo they are freed from ſin: And now it is all one as if thou ſhouldeſt proclaim, <hi>Come all Drunkards, come all Whore-maſters, come all Murderers and Liers; come all whatſoever; all your abominations ſhall here be turned to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and you ſhall walk according to your own Luſt without controll;</hi> And thus by thy ſubtilty thou thinkeſt to increaſe and multiply; for as there is in the whole Creation three degrees, that is, the Ignorant, the Learned, and the Prudent: Now the middle ſort have ever been counted for the multitude the which thou thinks thou art ſure to have, to make thee conſiderable, that ſo thou mayſt put into execution thy revengful Spirit, the which is to make Slaves and Bond-men of all thy Oppoſers.</p>
